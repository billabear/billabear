  Scenario: Get customer info
    When I have logged in as "sally.brown@example.org" with the password "AF@k3P@ss"
    And the follow customers exist:
      | Email                    | Country | External Reference | Reference    |

    And customer "customer.one@example.org" is disabled
    And the following webhook endpoints exist:
