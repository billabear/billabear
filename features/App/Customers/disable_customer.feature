Feature: Customer Disable APP
  In order to manage a customer
  As an APP user
  I need to be see what the customer info

  Background:
    Given the following accounts exist:
      | Name        | Email                   | Password  |
      | Sally Brown | sally.brown@example.org | AF@k3P@ss |
      | Tim Brown   | tim.brown@example.org   | AF@k3P@ss |
      | Sally Braun | sally.braun@example.org | AF@k3Pass |

  Scenario: Get customer info
    When I have logged in as "sally.brown@example.org" with the password "AF@k3P@ss"
    And the follow customers exist:
      | Email                    | Country | External Reference | Reference    |
      | customer.one@example.org | DE      | cust_jf9j545       | Customer One |
      | customer.two@example.org | UK      | cust_dfugfdu       | Customer Two |

    Then the customer "customer.one@example.org" is disabled
