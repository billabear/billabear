Feature: View prices
  In order to ensure the price data is correct for a product
  As an APP user
  I need to be able to view the prices for a product

  Background:
    Given the following accounts exist:
      | Name        | Email                   | Password  |
      | Sally Brown | sally.brown@example.org | AF@k3P@ss |
      | Tim Brown   | tim.brown@example.org   | AF@k3P@ss |
      | Sally Braun | sally.braun@example.org | AF@k3Pass |

  Scenario: View Product
    When I have logged in as "sally.brown@example.org" with the password "AF@k3P@ss"
    And the follow products exist:
      | Name        |
      | Product One |
      | Product Two |
    And the follow prices exist:
      | Product     | Amount | Currency | Recurring | Schedule | Public |
      | Product One | 1000   | USD      | true      | week     | true   |
      | Product One | 3000   | USD      | true      | month    | true   |
      | Product One | 30000  | USD      | true      | year     | false  |
    When I use the APP to view product "Product One"
    Then I will see the "prices" contains 3 items
